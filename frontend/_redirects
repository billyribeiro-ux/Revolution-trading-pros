# Cloudflare Pages Redirects - ICT 7 Configuration
# 
# NOTE: Cloudflare Pages does NOT support 200 (proxy) redirects to external URLs
# API proxying is handled by SvelteKit server routes instead:
# - /api/auth/login -> frontend/src/routes/api/auth/login/+server.ts
# - Other API calls use direct cross-origin with proper CORS headers
#
# This file is kept for SPA routing fallbacks only
