🔧 Dashboard Layout Suggestions
1. Top-Level Navigation Enhancements
Add a “Video Library” tab: A dedicated space for archived weekly videos, categorized by date, ticker, or strategy type (e.g., breakout, earnings, sector rotation).

“Trade Tracker” tab: Interactive log of past trades with filters (ticker, win/loss, duration, setup type). Could include charts or notes from each trade.

2. Main Content Area
Pin the Weekly Watchlist at the top: Make it visually distinct with a banner or highlight box so it’s always the first thing members see.

Add tags or filters to alerts: Let users sort by ticker, strategy type, or risk level. Example tags: “Momentum,” “Earnings Play,” “Options,” “Tech Sector.”

3. Video Integration
Timestamped breakdowns: For each video, include clickable timestamps like “NVDA setup – 2:14,” “TSLA exit – 6:45.”

Mini player or preview thumbnails: Let users hover to preview before clicking “Watch Now.”

4. Performance Section
Trend chart: Visualize win rate and profit over time (weekly or monthly).

Setup success breakdown: Pie chart showing which types of setups (e.g., breakouts, earnings, reversals) are performing best.

5. Sidebar Improvements
Add “My Alerts” or “Favorites”: Let users bookmark specific alerts or setups they want to track.

Quick access to “Strategy Guides”: Short PDFs or videos explaining your approach to runners, stops, and exits.

🧠 Functional Ideas
Alert Customization: Let users choose which tickers or setup types they want alerts for.

Trade Replay Tool: Interactive feature where users can replay your trades with charts and commentary.

Community Q&A or Comments: Optional space under each alert for members to ask questions or share thoughts.

Would you like help sketching out a wireframe or mockup for this enhanced layout? Or maybe we can brainstorm how to organize the video library next. Let’s build this dashboard into something traders will rave about.
